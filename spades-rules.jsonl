{ "text": "Each player decides how many tricks they will be able to take (as a minimum). The player to the dealer's left starts the bidding and, in turn, each player states how many tricks they expect to win. There is only one round of bidding, and the minimum bid is One.  It is common to play with a NIL bid, meaning no tricks will be taken.  It is also common to play with a 'Blind NIL' bid, where the player guesses they will avoid all tricks without the benefit of seeing their cards first.  Every player must make a bid; no player may pass. No suit is named in the bid, for as the name of the game implies, spades are always trump.", "metadata": "THE BIDDING" }
{ "text": "The game is scored by hands, and the winner must make a certain number of points, which is decided before the game begins. Five hundred points is common, but 200 points is suitable for a short game. The player on the dealer's left makes the opening lead, and players must follow suit, if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play a trump or discard. The trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or if no trump was played, the player who played the highest card in the suit led. The player who wins the trick leads next. Play continues until none of the players have any cards left. Each hand is worth 13 tricks. Spades cannot be led unless played previously or player to lead has nothing but Spades in his hand.", "metadata": "THE PLAY" }
{ "text": "For making the contract (the number of tricks bid), the player scores 10 points for each trick bid, plus 1 point for each overtrick.  Failure to make the contract results in -10 points for the value of the contract, no matter how many tricks were actually taken.  Bidding NIL and not taking any tricks is valued at 100 points, but taking any tricks is -100 points plus one bag per trick taken.  Blind NIL is +/- 200 plus one bag per trick taken.", "metadata": "HOW TO KEEP SCORE" }
